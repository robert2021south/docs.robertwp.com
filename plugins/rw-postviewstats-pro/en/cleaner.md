# 📦 Data Cleaner - User Guide (RW PostViewStats Pro)

## Overview

The Data Cleaner allows you to remove outdated daily view records, helping reduce database size while always keeping recent valid statistics.
It **never deletes all data** at once — recent view data is always preserved.

Lite and Pro versions behave differently regarding date limits and supported post types.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Go to **RW PostViewStats Pro → Data Cleaner** in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Select the **Post Type** you want to clean.
3. (Pro Only) Enter a **Date Limit** in the format `YYYYMMDD`
   - Only records **older than this date** will be deleted.
   - Example: Entering `20250501` will delete records **before May 1, 2025**.
4. Click **[Clean up now]** to execute the cleanup.
