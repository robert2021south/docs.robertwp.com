# Automatic Conversion

Automatic Conversion allows RW WebP Converter Lite to convert images to WebP format automatically when they are uploaded to WordPress.

This feature helps ensure new images are optimized without requiring manual action.

---

## How Automatic Conversion Works

Automatic conversion is triggered after an image upload is completed.

- The conversion logic is hooked into `wp_generate_attachment_metadata`
- Conversion runs **after WordPress generates image metadata**
- The plugin processes the **scaled original image** generated by WordPress
- Other image sizes (thumbnails, medium, large, etc.) are not converted

This ensures compatibility with WordPress core image handling.

---

## Supported Image Types

Automatic conversion supports the same formats as bulk conversion:

- JPG
- JPEG
- PNG

Other image formats are skipped automatically without notification.

---

## Image Size Rules

Automatic conversion follows the same size rules as bulk conversion.

- Images with their **longest edge smaller than the configured threshold**
- These images will be skipped and not converted

The size threshold can be configured in the **Settings** tab.

---

## Enabling or Disabling Automatic Conversion

- Automatic conversion is **enabled by default**
- You can disable it from the **Settings** tab
- The first checkbox in the Settings tab controls this behavior

When disabled:

- No automatic conversion is triggered
- Image uploads behave exactly as default WordPress uploads

---

## Output Behavior

Automatic conversion behaves exactly the same as bulk conversion:

- Original images are kept by default
- WebP files are generated alongside original images
- File naming follows the WordPress media library structure
- Only the file extension is changed to `.webp`

> URL replacement is not available in the Lite version and is a Pro feature.

---

## Conversion Records & Statistics

- Automatic conversions are included in **Recent Conversion Records**
- Execution time is recorded for each conversion
- Failed conversions are **not listed** in the records

Images that fail to convert will still appear as **not converted** in the statistics section.

---

## Error Handling

- If an image fails to convert, it is skipped
- Uploads are **never blocked**
- No error message or admin notice is displayed

This behavior is intentional to keep uploads uninterrupted and lightweight.

---

## Performance Notes

- Automatic conversion runs during image upload
- Upload time may increase slightly depending on server performance
- Shared hosting environments may experience slower uploads

Users who prefer full control can disable automatic conversion and use bulk conversion instead.

---

## Server Requirements

RW WebP Converter Lite requires one of the following PHP extensions:

- **GD Library**
- **Imagick**

WebP support depends on the available PHP image editor.

The plugin does **not** require the web server (Apache/Nginx) to natively serve WebP files.

---

## CDN & Cache Compatibility

- The Lite version does not include CDN or cache integration
- Automatic conversion only generates WebP files at the file level

Advanced delivery and URL replacement features are available in the Pro version.
